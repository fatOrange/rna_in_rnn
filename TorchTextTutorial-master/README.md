# TorchTextTutorial

Hello everyone, this is a simple tutorial that covers the basics of torchtext, an add-on package of Pytorch.

It is well-known that Pytorch is a brilliant deep learning library that is much simpler than its counterparts.

This simplicity is further aided by add-ons such as torchvision and torchtext.

However, due to the current lack of documentation, I had trouble understanding how torchtext operates at first and it took me a while to fully realize how many things in NLP can be done (so easily) with it.

This tutorial is to save others from the time that I spent fiddling with and understanding the available features.

Any questions or feedback are greatly appreciated, and if you have any questions / comments / advice / gossip / other nice things to say, you can contact me at devnote5676@naver.com or devnote5676@gmail.com :-)

#### Requirements
1. Basic knowledge of Pytorch
    - some great tutorials are provided at <https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial>
2. Pytorch, Torchtext and Spacy installed
