# Practical Torchtext
A set of tutorials for using torchtext effectively.
Current tutorials:
- Text classification
- Word-level language modeling

**Notice** : I am in the progress of migrating the contents of this repository to [my new repo on NLP using PyTorch](https://github.com/keitakurita/Practical_NLP_in_PyTorch). My new repo will eventually contain the most updated version of all the tutorials here.

# Purpose
The documentation of torchtext is still relatively incomplete, and using torchtext effectively currently requires reading through a fairly large amount of code. This set of tutorials aims to provide working examples of uses of torchtext to enable more users to make full use of this fanstastic library.

# Usage
The current pip release of torchtext has bugs that will make some of the code run incorrectly. These bugs are currently only fixed on the master branch of the github repository of torchtext. Therefore, I recommend you install torchtext from the github repository with the following command:

`$ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/pytorch/text`
